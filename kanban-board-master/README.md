Available Scripts
In the project directory, you can run:

npm install react-scripts
This script is necessary to run your React application using the command npm start.

npm start
Runs the app in development mode.
Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in your browser.

The page will automatically reload when you make changes.
Any lint errors will also be displayed in the console.

npm test
Starts the test runner in interactive watch mode.
Learn more in the running tests section.

npm run build
Builds the app for production in the build folder.
It bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for best performance.

The build is minified, and filenames include hashes for caching.
Your app will be ready for deployment.

Refer to the deployment section for more details.

npm run eject
Note: This is irreversible. Once you eject, you can't undo it!

You can eject if you're unsatisfied with the default build tools or configuration. It copies the configuration files and dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.) into your project for full control. All other commands will still work, but they'll reference the copied scripts.

You are not required to eject. The default setup is suitable for most small to medium projects. However, eject gives you the flexibility to customize the configuration when needed.
